# Animalize V-Lms

[Animalize](https://nextjs.org/) is a modern day Veterinary Lab Management System. It is a web application that helps veterinary labs manage their daily operations. It is built with Next.js, a React framework, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

Technology plays an integral part when developing such advanced applications. Our choices have been the best while choosing framework & dependencies

- Next.js for front end & origin-only API routes
- Styling with Tailwind utility classes
- Prisma ORM for connecting our front-end to our database.
- MongoDB as our primary database & Hygraph for media storage
